## Description

Replicating a Mondrian Composition using HTML and CSS only. A simple project to showcase my understanding of the use of CSS Grid. While tools exist like bootstrap & flexbox, I understand the importance of knowing how to create "complex layouts" using CSS Grid etc. This helps solidy my understanding of how to acheive these layouts with the use of other tools. The goal was to replicate the goal image from the section 10 project from the UDEMY course by Angela Yu ( see credits ).<br>
